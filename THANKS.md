## Issues

Thanks to everyone who has reported bugs and feature requests!

Especially the following people!

- [Dave Herman](https://github.com/dherman). Early on, Dave submitted
  _many_ helpful bug reports and feature requests. He was willing to
  try Frog instead of a more-obvious alternative. Having an early user
  like that was a great motivation.

- [Rommel M. Martinez](https://github.com/ebzzry), for using Frog on a
  project with 600+ migrated blog posts.
