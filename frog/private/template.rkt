#lang racket/base

;; Beware, cargo cults be here!
;;
;; The idea here is that we make some variables visible in the
;; namespace in which the template is evaluated. Some of these are the
;; variables and values explicitly passed to us in `dict`. The others
;; are from the modules web-server/templates and frog/widgets.
;;
;; Now, web-server/templates are normally used "statically" --
;; compiled into the web-server application. However it's also
;; possible to use them "dynamically" -- to load and use one at run
;; time.
;;
;; I wish I had a crisper understanding how and why the following
;; works, but it does, following this Racket mailing list thread:
;; http://www.mail-archive.com/users@racket-lang.org/msg18108.html
